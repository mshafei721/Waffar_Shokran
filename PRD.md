ðŸ“‹ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1\. Product Overview

This product is a web-first platform designed to help Egyptian consumers compare grocery and household product prices across various online retailers. It uses a parallelized multi-agent AI system to extract pricing data in real time and recommends the best available option based on price, size, and location. The product aims to reduce search time, improve decision-making, and ensure fairness in pricing visibility.



2\. Goals and Background Context

With high inflation and increasing cost-of-living pressures in Egypt, consumers are seeking ways to stretch their budgets. While many retailers list products online, the lack of a centralized, real-time comparison engine results in inefficiencies and uninformed purchases. This product seeks to democratize access to price information through intelligent scraping and aggregationâ€”making smart shopping accessible to anyone with a smartphone.
