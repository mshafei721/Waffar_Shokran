### Threat Modeling Frameworks

#### STRIDE Methodology
```yaml
Spoofing: Identity verification failures
Tampering: Data integrity violations  
Repudiation: Non-repudiation failures
Information Disclosure: Confidentiality breaches
Denial of Service: Availability attacks
Elevation of Privilege: Authorization bypasses
```

#### PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
```yaml
Stage 1: Define Objectives
Stage 2: Define Technical Scope
Stage 3: Application Decomposition
Stage 4: Threat Analysis
Stage 5: Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis
Stage 6: Attack Modeling
Stage 7: Risk and Impact Analysis
```

#### OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)
```yaml
Phase 1: Build Asset-Based Threat Profiles
Phase 2: Identify Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
Phase 3: Develop Security Strategy and Plans
```

### Security Architecture Patterns

Data Security:
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Data classification and labeling
  - Access controls and data masking

Infrastructure Security:
  - Hardened operating systems
  - Patch management and vulnerability scanning
  - Security monitoring and logging
```

#### Secure Communication Patterns
```yaml
API Security:
  - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
  - API rate limiting and throttling
  - Request signing and validation
  - API versioning and deprecation

Message Security:
  - Message encryption and signing
