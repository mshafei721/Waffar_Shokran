### Attack Scenario Documentation
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Stage Attack Scenario

Scenario: External to Internal Network Compromise
  Given an external attacker with public internet access
  When the attacker performs reconnaissance and discovers exposed services
  And exploits a web application vulnerability for initial access
  And escalates privileges through local vulnerability exploitation
  And moves laterally through network using credential harvesting
  Then the attacker gains access to sensitive internal systems
  And demonstrates complete network compromise and data exfiltration

Scenario: Insider Threat Simulation
  Given a malicious insider with standard user privileges
  When the insider abuses legitimate access to gather intelligence
  And exploits misconfigured security controls for privilege escalation
  And accesses sensitive data beyond authorized scope
  Then the insider successfully exfiltrates confidential information
  And maintains persistent access for ongoing data theft
