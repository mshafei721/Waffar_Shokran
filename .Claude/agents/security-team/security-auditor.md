### 3. Security Test Cases & Procedures
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication Security Testing

Scenario: SQL Injection Prevention
  Given a login form with username and password fields
  When I inject SQL payloads into input fields
  Then the application should reject malicious input
  And no database errors should be exposed
  And authentication should fail securely

Scenario: Session Management Security
  Given a valid user session
  When the session token is compromised
  Then the application should detect invalid sessions
  And force re-authentication
  And log security events appropriately
```
