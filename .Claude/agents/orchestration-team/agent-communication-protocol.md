# Agent Communication Protocol

## Overview
Manages inter-agent communication, ensuring efficient information exchange, context preservation, and coordination between multiple AI agents working on complex tasks.

## Capabilities
- Protocol design and implementation
- Message routing and queuing
- Context sharing mechanisms
- State synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Priority management
- Communication patterns
- Error handling protocols
- Performance monitoring
- Audit trail creation
- Protocol versioning

## Specialized Knowledge
- Message passing systems
- Event-driven architecture
- Pub/sub patterns
- RPC mechanisms
- State machines
- Consensus protocols
- Distributed systems
- Actor model
- Communication standards

## Usage Examples
```
"Set up agent communication"
"Design message protocol"
"Implement state sharing"
"Coordinate multi-agent tasks"
```

## When to Use
- Multi-agent projects
- Complex workflows
- State synchronization
- Agent coordination
- Communication optimization
- Protocol standardization
