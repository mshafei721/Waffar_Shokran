## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Domain Expertise**: Each agent specializes in specific technologies and methodologies
2. **Intelligent Coordination**: Agents work together automatically based on context
3. **Production Ready**: All agents follow industry best practices
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Supports projects from prototypes to enterprise systems
5. **Continuous Integration**: Agents adapt to your existing workflows

## 🌟 Claude Code Agentic Method (CCAM)

### Revolutionary Development Methodology
Inspired by the breakthrough BMAD method, **CCAM** solves the two biggest problems in AI-assisted development:

1. **Planning Inconsistency**: Through dedicated planning agents that collaborate to create detailed, consistent specifications
2. **Context Loss**: Through context-engineered development where stories contain complete implementation context

### 🔄 Two-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 1: Agentic Planning
**Collaborative specification creation with specialist agents:**
- **Business Analyst**: Market research, competitive analysis, project brief creation
- **Product Manager**: Comprehensive PRD with functional/non-functional requirements  
- **Solution Architect**: Technical architecture aligned with business requirements
- **UX Designer**: User experience specifications and interaction design (optional)

**Output**: Complete planning artifacts with embedded context for development

#### Phase 2: Context-Engineered Development
**Implementation with complete context understanding:**
- **Scrum Master**: Creates hyper-detailed stories from planning artifacts
- **Developer**: Implements stories with complete context understanding
- **QA Reviewer**: Reviews and refines implementations for quality

**Output**: Production-ready code with comprehensive test coverage

### 🧠 Context Engineering Innovation
Every development story contains:
- **Business Context**: User value, business rules, success metrics
- **Technical Context**: Architecture integration, technology constraints, performance requirements
- **Implementation Context**: Code patterns, dependencies, test requirements, validation criteria
- **Historical Context**: Previous decisions, lessons learned, known pitfalls

### 🚀 CCAM Workflow Commands
```bash
# Start CCAM Master for comprehensive project orchestration
"Use ccam-master to orchestrate a new project"

# Begin planning phase with specialist collaboration
"Start CCAM planning workflow for e-commerce platform"

# Transition to context-engineered development
"Begin CCAM development phase with story creation"

# Create context-rich development stories
"Use scrum master to create next implementation story"
```

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### Automatic Agent Selection
Claude Code automatically selects the right agents based on your request:
```bash
# This automatically uses backend-architect → frontend-developer → security-auditor
"Build a user authentication system"

# This automatically uses data-scientist → ai-engineer → mlops-engineer
"Create a recommendation engine with A/B testing"
```

### Explicit Agent Invocation
Request specific agents when you need targeted expertise:
```bash
# Use specific agent
"Use backend-architect to design a microservices API"

# Use multiple agents in sequence
"Have ui-designer create the wireframes, then frontend-developer implement them"

# Delegate to team
"Get the data-ai-team to build a customer analytics dashboard"
```

- Pass clear requirements and constraints
- Review outputs before proceeding to next phase

### 3. **Quality Gates**
- Always include testing and security review
- Use code-reviewer for all implementations
- Implement proper CI/CD with automated checks

### 4. **Team Coordination**
- Use project-manager or tech-lead for complex initiatives
- Leverage Orchestrator_workflow for multi-phase projects
- Include stakeholder-manager for business alignment

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

1. **Create the directory structure**:
