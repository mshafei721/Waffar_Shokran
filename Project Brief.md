ðŸ§¾ Project Brief â€“ Egyptian Price Comparison App
1. Problem Statement & Context
Egyptian consumers routinely face significant price differences for identical grocery and household items across major retailers. With no centralized visibility into real-time prices, shoppers are forced to manually check multiple platformsâ€”wasting time and often overpaying. Despite increased mobile and web-based shopping in Egypt, fragmented listings and inconsistent data make it difficult to make informed purchasing decisions.

2. Solution Summary
A multi-agent AI-powered web application that enables Egyptian consumers to find the cheapest prices for grocery and household items across local online retailers. By entering a product name and basic details, users receive a real-time, visually organized price comparison table showing the lowest available prices, the retailer offering them, and links to purchase. The system also suggests equivalent alternatives (if exact matches arenâ€™t found), adjusts for size/weight variations, and provides store locations if needed. Built with shared memory and parallel agent execution, the system ensures speed, accuracy, and intelligence. It will support Arabic and be optimized for simplicity, clarity, and mobile-first migration.

3. Target User Profile
The app is designed for cost-conscious Egyptian households and individuals, particularly middle- and lower-income families, who want to make informed purchasing decisions without wasting time. Typical users are mobile-savvy, frequently shop online, and are frustrated by inconsistent prices across platforms. The solution also appeals to urban residents who value convenience and are open to trying technology that saves money.
